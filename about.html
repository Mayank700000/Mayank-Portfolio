      Journey:
    </p >
    <div class="sc">
     
      Started off with basic HTML, then dove into the wild worlds of CSS, JavaScript, and more! Learning the ropes of programming online, I crafted mini projects left and right, honing my skills through endless practice sessions.
      <br><br>
      Each new challenge pushed my boundaries further, transforming frustration into triumph as I debugged code and saw my creations come to life. I remember the thrill of my first responsive website, the satisfaction of making a button interact dynamically, and the awe of creating animations that danced across the screen.<br>
      
      
      <br>
      
      Today, my journey continues with a never-ending curiosity and a passion for creating meaningful digital experiences. Whether it's developing user-friendly applications, contributing to open-source projects, or mentoring new coders, I find joy in every line of code and every problem solved. The world of programming is vast, and I am eager to explore its endless horizons.
